<h1 style="text-align: center;">Beta Prediction (CAPM Model)</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. CAPM is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky securities and generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and cost of capital.</p>

<h3>Advantages of the CAPM:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CAPM has several advantages over other methods of calculating required return, explaining why it has been popular for more than 40 years:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. It considers only systematic risk, reflecting a reality in which most investors have diversified portfolios from which unsystematic risk has been essentially eliminated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. It is a theoretically-derived relationship between required return and systematic risk which has been subject to frequent empirical research and testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. It is generally seen as a much better method of calculating the cost of equity than the dividend growth model (DGM) in that it explicitly considers a company&rsquo;s level of systematic risk relative to the stock market as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. It is clearly superior to the WACC in providing discount rates for use in investment appraisal</p>

<h3>Beta values:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market and finally, a Beta less than 1 means that it will be less volatile than the market. Beta values can be roughly characterized as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. b Less than 0: Negative Beta is possible but not likely. People thought gold stocks should have negative Betas but that hasn't been true. <br /><br />2. b Equal to 0: Cash under your mattress, assuming no inflation! <br /><br />3. b Between 0 and 1: Low-volatility investments (e.g., utility stocks). <br /><br />4. b Equal to 1: Matching the index. <br /><br />5. b Greater than 1: Anything more volatile than the index. <br /><br />6. b Much Greater than 1: Impossible, because the stock would be expected to go to zero on any market decline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Result:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beta value predicted using both methods, i.e. regression and covariance/variance approach is approximately same.</p>
